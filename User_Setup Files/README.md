  ## User_Setup Files

<b>Add these files to your "C:\Users\YOURCOMPUTERNAMEHERE\Documents\Arduino\libraries\TFT_eSPI-master" folder. After you have them added to the folder, go into the
<br>
"User_Setup_Select" file and make sure #include <User_Setups/Setup25_TTGO_T_Display.h> is uncommented. It should be when you download it but just double check.</b>
