  ## User_Setup Files

</div>

<b>These files allow you to easy define a user setup for the ttgo t-display in Arduino IDE. <br>
Upon compiling a sketch in IDE you should define the board as a "LOLIN D32" and set the  partiton to "minimal with spiffs".</b>

<b>Add these files to your "C:\Users\YOURCOMPUTERNAMEHERE\Documents\Arduino\libraries\TFT_eSPI-master" folder. <br>
After you have them added to the folder, go into the "User_Setup_Select" file and make sure <br> #include <User_Setups/Setup25_TTGO_T_Display.h> is uncommented. <br>
It should be when you download it but just double check.</b>
