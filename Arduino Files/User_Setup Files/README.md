  ## User_Setup Files

</div>

<b>These files allow you to easy define a user setup for the ttgo t-display in Arduino IDE. <br>
Upon compiling a sketch in IDE you should define the board as a "LOLIN D32" and set the  partiton to "minimal with spiffs".</b>

<br>

- Make a full backup of your \Arduino\libraries\ folder and keep it somewhere safe to revert to if you run into any errors.

- Add these files to your "C:\Users\YOURNAME\Documents\Arduino\libraries\TFT_eSPI-master" folder.
  After you have them added to the folder, go into the "User_Setup_Select" file and make sure #include <User_Setup_TTGO_NoTouch.h> is uncommented. 
  It should be when you download it but just double check.
